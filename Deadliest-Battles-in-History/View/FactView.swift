With the Volga river a key route from the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea to central Russia, Stalingrad (today named ‚ÄúVolgograd‚Äù) was strategically important and every available soldier and civilian was mobilised to defend it. The fact that it was named after the Soviet leader himself also made the city important to both sides in terms of its propaganda value. Hitler even said that, if captured, all of Stalingrad‚Äôs men would be killed and its women and children deported.")
